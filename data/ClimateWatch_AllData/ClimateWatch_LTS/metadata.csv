No evaluation of ambition has been undertaken. Rather the database is provided to facilitate transparency and understanding of countries' long-term strategies.<br>For Ã¢â‚¬Å“legal backing,Ã¢â‚¬Â full legal backing means that the long-term target and the development of the LTS are mandated by law, partial legal backing means one of the two, and no legal backing means neither.
